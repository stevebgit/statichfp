look at seo.js at the wordpress versions of wordpress that I installed

test out the localhost:8000 to see how it's working.. there's a dupe title there.

so need to add some more classes to the css..

check out style.css in root.. that's stragith from the wp style.css.. you need to add: 

divi-100-article-card  class to your html in the article.js component
